neuRoi
======

A Matlab toolbox for calcium imaging data analysis.

neuRoi

Many of the neuRoi functions are from the [ROIing toolbox](https://github.com/PTRRupprecht/Drawing-ROIs-without-GUI) developed by Peter Rupprecht.

## Installation
Download the source code. Then add the directory of the source code to MATLAB path. Note that you do not need to include sub-folders in the path.
Required MATLAB packages:
* DSP System Toolbox
* Image Processing Toolbox

## Documentation & Wiki

Wiki page of this tool box can be found here[wiki page](https://github.com/aloejhb/neuRoi/wiki).

## Demos
Demos can be found in the /demos folder.
First run preprocess.m for data preprocessing. Then run extract_time_trace.m to draw ROIs manually and extract time traces.
This work-flow will soon be integrated in a guided procedure in GUI.
